# Back to the Gate

Reverse Horror 7DRL.

You wake up soaked in the blood of the scientist that was studying your egg. The Call is strong, but you are weak and small, activity is all around you, still you have to descend back into the excavation and reach the Hellgate to free your brethren, will you survive with stealth, strength… or something else entirely?

## Core

You start a new life as a small fiend and must navigate procedurally generated levels until you reach the Hellgate to start the apocalypse, with increasingly difficult enemies from scientists to soldiers.

Your main weapon is stealth, you can instant-kill enemies that are unaware of you and feed on them, using blood to gain abilities over three skill trees:

1. **Stealth:** enable you to make better use of illumination and be invisible on certain tiles.
2. **Strength:** makes you more durable and increase your attack in combat.
3. **Fear:** give you limited control of your opponents.

## Level Generation

A few types of levels are the Lab, the Courtyard/Site and the Excavation, with different generation algorithms (BSP, Custom, Random Walk).

In the Lab and Excavation special passages on a second layer enable you to traverse the level easily, such as air-vents, and ambush humans. Certain tiles of “creep” in the lower levels increase your stealth.

A nice idea, if there is time, would be to allow good Players to win by escaping the Courtyard.

## Lighting and Line of Sight

It would be nice to have a lighting system to exploit (increasing your stealth rating) and showing Line of Sight of enemies (even as static overlay).

## Advancement

Three Skill Trees (lines), the last Skill changes the Character sprite.

| Path | L1 | L2 | L3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stealth | Stalker (+stealth) | Camouflage (invisible when still) | Blink (teleport) |
| Strength  | Chitin (+Armor) | Rend (+Attack) | Brute (+Armor, +Attack) |
| Fear | Whispers (look away) | Scare (flee in terror) | Paranoia (attack allies) |

## Extra Time

- **Doors**. The tunnels can be used to avoid closed doors, the first area could be always closed and guaranteed with a tunnel to explain the mechanic.
- **Caution Level**. As time progresses or people die, increase awareness and attention of enemies.
- **Artifacts**. Each level contains a Hellish Artifact that boosts a passive ability.
- **Cameras**. If in LOS, warn close enemies/add Caution Level.
- **Intro**. First person POV as your egg opens on a scientist and soldier, blood splatters the screen and as it fades the game start with the title.

## Shortcuts

- The Passages are not "real", once entered you can move freely and just go out at another end.
